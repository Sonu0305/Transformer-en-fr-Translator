# Transformer-en-fr-Translator
# Transformer-based English-to-French Translation Model

This repository contains the code and resources for a transformer-based model designed to translate English text into French. The model was trained on parallel English and French datasets, leveraging a transformer architecture to achieve high-quality translation results.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build and fine-tune a transformer-based neural network for machine translation. The model leverages attention mechanisms to improve translation accuracy and handles complex language structures effectively. It was trained over multiple epochs, reaching a significant level of accuracy at epoch 85.

### Model Architecture

The model is based on a transformer architecture, which is particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequence-to-sequence data, such as machine translation. Key components include:

- **Attention Mechanism:** The model uses multi-head self-attention layers to capture dependencies in both the source (English) and target (French) sequences.
- **Positional Encoding:** Positional information is added to the input embeddings to capture the order of tokens in each sequence.
- **Layer Stacking:** Multiple encoder and decoder layers enable the model to learn complex linguistic patterns.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a parallel English-French dataset, processed into tokens and further encoded to create input-output pairs for supervised learning.

### Vocabulary

The English and French datasets were tokenized and encoded separately, yielding vocabularies of approximately:

- **English Vocabulary:** ~15,000 words (based on `spaCy` tokenization)
- **French Vocabulary:** ~26,000 words (based on `spaCy` tokenization)

## Training Details

The model was trained for **85 epochs**. The training process involved optimizing cross-entropy loss between the predicted and actual token sequences. Training was conducted on a Kaggle GPU instance with **CUDA 10.2** support.
